        <h2>This is not only also one of my boyfriends fav recipes, but his recipe, and its amazing</h2>
        <p>This spanish tortilla is easy to make, but it can be tricky, and it's a delicious dish for lunch or dinner</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium sized potatoes</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>frying oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First you have to peel and cut the potatoes in small-ish cubes. <br>
                While you do that you can put a pan on medium heat and heat your oil to fry the potatoes</li>
            <li>When all your potatoes are cut and peeled you have to fry them in a few patches until they are golden</li>
            <li>Once all your potatoes are done, you have to beat the eggs, add salt and pepper and then add that to the fried potatoes</li>
            <li>At this point you need a pan, the same you used before if you want, with a thin layer of oil covering all of it in medium heat.<br>
                Then you have to add you mixture of potatoes and egg</li>
            <li>Let it cook until it moves freely when you shake the pan and doesn't stick to it.<br>
                Now comes the tricky part, take the pan, cover it with a plate bigger than the pan itself and turn it around quickly so the tortilla is on the plate. <br>
                Then you want to put the half-cooked tortilla back on the pan sliding it off the plate into the pan again</li>
            <li>Let the tortilla cook at least until it slides in the pan when u shake it. <br>
                Depending on how you like it, you can cook it for longer or not, resulting in a runny centre or a more stiff cooked one</li>
            <li>To finish, just slide it off the pan into the plate, cut in slices like a cake or a pizza and enjoy with anyone you want (or save for later, its also good cold)</li>
        </ol>
